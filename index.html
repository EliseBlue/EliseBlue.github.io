      <p id="intro"> This is an expression of my creative abilities; an exhibition of me. Welcome to the world of Brook Elise Blue. Please explore my artwork, eye for color and design, and allow your mind to take you where it may. Although there's no true way to capture the sprititual essence or spiritual embodiment of what defines me, the energy of this creation, I hope, provides a small piece of me. My passion lies in my dream to open a healing retreat and intentional community in the wilderness of Oregon. I am an herbalist, permaculture enthusiast, and artist of many mediums. I am a student of life. Open your mind. Learn from me and teach me. Let's spread the energy together. I want to be the bridge to new paths that bring people inspiration and a new way of thinking about the world. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Please enjoy my work and the skills that helped to create what you see here.</p>
